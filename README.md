# CTF Practice

## solving past CTFs (the only way to learn really)

### Note

- all challenges can be found in the ***challenges*** directory
- each directory within the ***challenges*** folder represent a challenge
- naming will be in the format ***CTFNAME_YEAR_CATEGORY_CHALLENGE_NAME***
- each challenge should contain a ***tldr_writeup.md*** and a ***mine.py*** file for writeup and solution respectively
- in most case the the writeups are based on other people's writeups (I may provide link to full writeups)
